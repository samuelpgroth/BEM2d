# BEM2d

Matlab directory for simulating wave scattering by polygons in two dimensions via Galerkin boundary element using 
standard piecewise polynomial approximation spaces.

Currently only time-harmonic sound-soft scattering is supported, see example script
exampleScatteringSoundSoft.m Such a scattering problem looks like this:

## To do:
1. Convolution quadrature for transient waves

2. Transmission problems

3. Sound-hard boundary conditions
