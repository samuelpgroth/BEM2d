# BEM2d

Matlab directory for simulating wave scattering by polygons in two dimensions via Galerkin boundary element using 
standard piecewise polynomial approximation spaces.

Currently only time-harmonic sound-soft scattering is supported.

## To do:
1. Convolution quadrature for transient waves

2. Transmission problems

3. Sound-hard boundary conditions
